# What is this?

This is my own fork of [Bazzite](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite) with some packages layered in that I need for.. something? idk. I run Bazzite on a desktop to play games without needing a Windows install. I do not recommend running this fork, but I have made it public if you feel compelled to do so. 

# Installation ðŸ’¿

1. Install [Fedora Silverblue](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/)
2. Rebase to `zoe-os` with this command: `rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/virtualdisk/zoe-os:latest`
